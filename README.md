# Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project applies unsupervised learning techniques, specifically K-Means Clustering, to segment customers based on their demographic and behavioral attributes. The dataset used is the publicly available **Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset**.

## 🧠 Objective
To identify distinct customer segments that can be used by businesses to personalize marketing strategies, improve customer experience, and enhance business decision-making.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial)
- **Attributes**:
  - Gender
  - Age
  - Annual Income (k$)
  - Spending Score (1-100)

## 🧮 Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing (Encoding, Scaling)
2. Optimal Cluster Identification using Elbow Method
3. K-Means Clustering
4. PCA for 2D Visualization of Clusters

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Results
- 5 distinct customer clusters identified
- Clear separation using PCA visualization
- Business insights can be drawn from each customer group

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo or download the code.
2. Install required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script

## 📈 Visualization
